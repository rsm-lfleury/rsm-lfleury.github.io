## Operations Analytics Project: Rogers Market

**Problem:** Investigated the operational efficiency of Rogers Market’s Amazon walk-out technology by analyzing average student trip duration and in-store customer levels.

**Approach:**
- Constructed an inventory-over-time diagram (customers in store vs. time) and computed average in-store inventory by dividing the total area under the curve by total operating time.
- Validated the observed average inventory using Little’s Law by multiplying average throughput and average flow time.

**Outcome:** Demonstrated that the average in-store customer level (~5.2 customers) computed from observed data matched the value predicted by Little’s Law, validating the consistency of the system metrics.
